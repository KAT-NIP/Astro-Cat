Load "Wormhole_FX.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the Wormhole effect from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

There's several parameters available for the Wormhole; expand out the Wormhole gameobject in the Hierarchy window and you'll find Tunnel_Main (the main tunnel) and Tunnel_Electricity (additional streaks and electricity ring). Under each of these you'll find a child of the same name (ie under Tunnel_Main you'll find a child Tunnel_Main); select these and then in the Inspector window (on the right) under the Wormhole script you'll find options for texture speed, texture twist and mesh anim speed.

Have fun!
